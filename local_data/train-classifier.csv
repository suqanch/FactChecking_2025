"Severe ‘snowmageddon’ winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked.","Rapid, dramatic temperature swings were common, with temperatures sometimes reverting from normal or above-normal summer temperatures as high as 95 °F (35 °C) to near-freezing within hours.",1
"“So the bottom line of all this is that climate change is natural, not man-made.",Delineated from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump in December 1946.,0
"unadjusted data suggests that temperatures in Australia have only increased by 0.3 degrees over the past century, not the 1 degree usually claimed","The Paine Furniture Building is an historic commercial building at 75-81 Arlington Street in Boston, Massachusetts.",0
"On the other side of the Atlantic ocean, climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream.","The worst single incident of air pollution to occur in the US occurred in Donora, Pennsylvania in late October, 1948, when 20 people died and over 7,000 were injured.",0
There is long-term correlation between CO2 and global temperature; other effects are short-term.,"This trend could be extrapolated to continue into the future, possibly leading to a full ice age, but the twentieth-century instrumental temperature record shows a sudden reversal of this trend, with a rise in global temperatures attributed to greenhouse gas emissions.",1
Renewables can't provide baseload power,"""Supplying Baseload Power and Reducing Transmission Requirements by Interconnecting Wind Farms"" (PDF).",1
"Over the three years from 1979 to 1982 when CO2 emissions were decreasing due to the rapid increase in the price of oil that drastically reduced consumption, there was no change in the rate of increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 proving that humans were not the primary source for the increase in concentration.'","Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), and secondarily the clearing of land, have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide, methane, and other heat-trapping (""greenhouse"") gases in the atmosphere...There is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.",1
Satellite error inflated Great Lakes temperatures,"Because it is the shallowest, it is also the warmest of the Great Lakes, and in 1999 this almost became a problem for two nuclear power plants which require cool lake water to keep their reactors cool.",1
Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs.,"Informed by the Energy White Paper 2003, the bill aims to achieve a mandatory reduction of 60% in the carbon emission from the 1990 level by 2050, with an intermediate target of between 26% and 32% by 2020.",1
There is long-term correlation between CO2 and global temperature; other effects are short-term.,El Niño events cause short-term (approximately 1 year in length) spikes in global average surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling.,1
CO2 emissions were much smaller 100 years ago.,"Carbon dioxide mole fractions in the atmosphere have gone up by approximately 35 percent since the 1900s, rising from 280 parts per million by volume to 387 parts per million in 2009.",1
An independent inquiry found CRU is a small research unit with limited resources and their rigour and honesty are not in doubt.,"According to his account, he twice turned down Vietminh offers of a cabinet position in 1946 to follow Emperor Bảo Đại to China and Hong Kong.",0
"Scientists have known for some time, from multiple lines of evidence, that humans are changing Earth’s climate, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions.","Where the Stadium Golf Course is today was once the Schenectady Stadium, which housed the minor-league team the Schenectady Blue Jays from 1946 to 1957.",0
"and three Nobel economic laureates support ""direct investment in technology"" rather than a carbon tax.",They divorced in 1989 and she married film maker Ramesh Sharma in 1991.,0
"Small increases in average temperature translate to big increases in the number of extremely hot days, and those hot days have a big impact.","Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a feedback loop.",0
the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’,"The 2017 United States-published National Climate Assessment notes that ""climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes"".",1
But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.,"The effects of climate change on human systems, mostly due to warming and shifts in precipitation, have been detected worldwide.",1
