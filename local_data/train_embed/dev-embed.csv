The interesting point is that it also seems each time they come across a new  dataset it is simply replaced.,"The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias and to give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset (i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem).",Nordhaus takes on a descriptive approach which “assumes that investments to slow climate change must compete with investments in other areas.” While Stern takes on a prescriptive approach in which “leads to the conclusion that any positive pure rate of time preference is unethical.”
"But we do have other reliable indicators of temperatures before the late 1800s, and the evidence shows temperatures have been warmer than today for most of the past several thousand years, including warmer-than-present temperatures for most of the human civilization time period","At around 41.5 million years ago, stable isotopic analysis of samples from Southern Ocean drilling sites indicated a warming event for 600 thousand years.",This eliminates the planet's negative feedbacks and increases the likelihood of homeostatic positive feedback potential associated with runaway global warming.
The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather,"Other likely changes are listed below: Increased areas will be affected by drought There will be increased intense tropical cyclone activity There will be increased incidences of extreme high sea level (excluding tsunamis) Storm strength leading to extreme weather is increasing, such as the power dissipation index of hurricane intensity.",The east of the Pindus mountain range is generally drier and windier in summer.

"For example, we have a lower understanding of the effect of aerosols while we have a high understanding of the warming effect of carbon dioxide.",Carbon dioxide is of greatest concern because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than all of these other gases combined and because it has a long atmospheric lifetime (hundreds to thousands of years).,"In a state that is presently faced with various renewable energy issues, the idea of terminating personal property taxes on solar panels was widely supported."
"Extreme high temperatures were seen from India — where the city of Phalodi recorded temperatures of 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 Fahrenheit) in May, a new national record — to Iran, where a temperature of 53 degrees Celsius (127.4 F) was recorded in Delhoran on July 22.",It holds the record for the highest verified temperature recorded in India at 51 °C (124 °F) on 19 May 2016.,There have been no records since the 1980s and it is possibly extinct.
Research has found a human influence on the climate of the past several decades ...,"This report explicitly endorses the IPCC view of attribution of recent climate change as representing the view of the scientific community: The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability.",Healthy ecosystems provide important ecosystem services that can contribute to climate change adaptation.
"While the link between cosmic rays and cloud cover is yet to be confirmed, more importantly, there has been no correlation between cosmic rays and global temperatures over the last 30 years of global warming.","Together with the lack of a proven physical mechanism and the plausibility of other causal factors affecting changes in cloud cover, this makes the association between galactic cosmic ray-induced changes in aerosol and cloud formation controversial Studies by Lockwood and Fröhlich (2007) and Sloan and Wolfendale (2008) found no relation between warming in recent decades and cosmic rays.","These unconventional sources are more labor and resource intensive to produce, however, requiring extra energy to refine, resulting in higher production costs and up to three times more greenhouse gas emissions per barrel (or barrel equivalent) on a ""well to tank"" basis or 10 to 45% more on a ""well to wheels"" basis, which includes the carbon emitted from combustion of the final product."

A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.”,But recently scientists and scholars have challenged the legitimacy of this journalistic core value with regard to matters of great importance on which the overwhelming majority of the scientific community has reached a well-substantiated consensus view.,Some of the people were seriously hurt... however now we can see that the island has recovered from the losses and returned to their previous life...
The clearest of these is simple accounting - humans are emitting CO2 at a rate twice as fast as the atmospheric increase (natural sinks are absorbing the other half).,"It is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year.","In evolutionary biology, parasite load has important implications for sexual selection and the evolution of sex, as well as openness to experience."

The long-term correlation between CO2 and temperature is well established.,Correlation of CO 2 and temperature is not part of this evidence.,"They deny that natural selection occurred purely by chance, or merely by survival of the fittest – and view each stage of the evolutionary process as being selectively and continually woven to an intricate level by one creator (Allah)."
"Scientists have known for some time, from multiple lines of evidence, that humans are changing Earth’s climate, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions.","In the scientific literature, there is an overwhelming consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.","The resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include clean water, clean air, food, shelter, warmth, and other resources necessary to sustain life."
"Also found was that the correlation between solar activity and global temperatures ended around 1975, hence recent warming must have some other cause than solar variations.","Neither direct measurements nor proxies of solar variation correlate well with Earth global temperature, particularly in recent decades when both quantities are best known.",The Little Ice Age caused crop failures and famines in Europe.
"Data from NOAA’s Barrow Alaska station ‘indicate that October through December emissions of CO2 from surrounding tundra increased by 73 percent since 1975, supporting the view that rising temperatures have made Arctic ecosystems a net source of CO2.’”",The sharp acceleration in CO 2 emissions since 2000 to more than a 3% increase per year (more than 2 ppm per year) from 1.1% per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed nations.,Flowering peaks between September and November in its native range.
This increases confidence in other peer-reviewed research predicting sea level rise of 80cm to 2 metres by 2100.,"However, Greg Holland from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who reviewed the study, noted: “There is no doubt that the sea level rise, within the IPCC, is a very conservative number, so the truth lies somewhere between IPCC and Jim.” In addition, one 2017 study's scenario, assuming high fossil fuel use for combustion and strong economic growth during this century, projects sea level rise of up to 132 cm (4.3 ft) on average — and an extreme scenario with as much as 189 cm (6.2 ft), by 2100.","A recent study suggests that its closest relatives are not in adjacent mainland China, but in south-east Asia, and that they spread along continental shelf areas exposed by lowered sea levels during the ice age."
Plants need almost three times today’s carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere to thrive.,"Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO 2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients.",Life on Earth is based on carbon and water.
"“The notion that world-wide weather is becoming more extreme is just that: a notion, or a testable hypothesis.","This will be the one which not only has hitherto stood up to the severest tests, but the one which is also testable in the most rigorous way.","In the case of the Earth-atmosphere system, it refers to the process by which long-wave (infrared) radiation is emitted to balance the absorption of short-wave (visible) energy from the Sun."
"“Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.","To inform decisions on adaptation and mitigation, it is critical that we improve our understanding of the global climate system and our ability to project future climate through continued and improved monitoring and research.",Part of the cooling trend seen by the satellites can be attributed to several years of cooler than normal temperatures and cooling caused by the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano.

There are many lines of evidence which clearly show that the atmospheric CO2 increase is caused by humans.,"The introduction includes this statement: There is strong evidence that the warming of the Earth over the last half-century has been caused largely by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, including agriculture and deforestation.","Plants tend to flower in alternate years, similarly to mast years in grasses and trees."
Ancient natural cycles are irrelevant for attributing recent global warming to humans.,"Anthropogenic climate change is caused by human activity, as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of Earth's natural processes.",Externalities can be either positive or negative.
"The statement that so-called greenhouse gases,  especially CO2, contribute to near-surface atmospheric warming is in  glaring contradiction to well-known physical laws relating to gas and  vapour, as well as to general caloric theory.'","It said that Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.","For the five years through November 2017, Georgia has been ranked the top state (number 1) in the nation to do business, and has been recognized as number 1 for business and labor climate in the nation, number 1 in business climate in the nation, number 1 in the nation in workforce training and as having a ""Best in Class"" state economic development agency."
But as the change gets larger or more persistent … it appears they underestimate climate change,"Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but now agrees well with observations.","Aerosol pollution had decreased in many areas due to environmental legislation and changes in fuel use, and it became clear that the cooling effect from aerosols was not going to increase substantially while carbon dioxide levels were progressively increasing."

"Our children and grandchildren will look back on the climate deniers and ask how they could have sacrificed the planet for the sake of cheap fossil fuel energy, when the cost of inaction exceeds the cost of a transition to a low-carbon economy,’ Watson said.",At the core of most proposals is the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through reducing energy waste and switching to low-carbon power sources of energy.,"During the five-years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies, while actual production grew 1.2% overall."
"If Houlton’s finding about these vast, previously unknown nitrogen stores holds true, then it would have an enormous impact on global warming predictions.","When the model included estimated changes in solar intensity, it gave a reasonable match to temperatures over the previous thousand years and its prediction was that ""CO 2 warming dominates the surface temperature patterns soon after 1980.""","Dessler has suggested that scientists advocating for climate change mitigation should tell their personal stories and that this would reveal the strategy of ad hominem attacks by climate change deniers, an attempt to portray scientists to audiences as ""not 'like them."
"Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900: a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century, before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it, and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century.","Increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.","In meadows, tall grasses that can take advantage of higher nitrogen levels may change the area so that natural species may be lost."

"Volcanoes, solar variations, clouds, methane, aerosols - these all change the way energy enters and/or leaves our climate.","These include processes such as variations in solar radiation, variations in the Earth's orbit, variations in the albedo or reflectivity of the continents, atmosphere, and oceans, mountain-building and continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.","In 2005, with respect to the U.S. Congress's actions on climate, including its votes on the XL Pipeline, Romm told ""The Guardian"": ""Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse."
Lindzen and Choi’s paper is viewed as unacceptably flawed by other climate scientists.,"This claim was criticized by climatologist Gavin Schmidt, Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who notes the more generally-accepted understanding of the effects of the Iris effect and cites empirical cases where large and relatively rapid changes in the climate such as El Niño events, the Ultra-Plinian eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, and recent trends in global temperature and water vapor levels to show that, as predicted in the generally-accepted view, water vapor increases as the temperature increases, and decreases as temperatures decrease.","Rudyard has the distinction of being the only community in the contiguous United States that sits atop a non-oceanic antipode, that being one of the Kerguelen Islands."

"The earth is 15 years from a “mini ice-age” that will cause bitterly cold winters during which rivers such as the Thames freeze over, scientists have predicted.","During a series of cold winters the Thames froze over above London Bridge: in the first Frost Fair in 1607, a tent city was set up on the river, along with a number of amusements, including ice bowling.","Conservation's goals include protecting species from extinction, maintaining and restoring habitats, enhancing ecosystem services and protecting biological diversity."
"A natural cycle requires a forcing, and no known forcing exists that fits the fingerprints of observed warming - except anthropogenic greenhouse gases.","The spatial and temporal fingerprint of warming can be traced to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, which are a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale deforestation and other human activity.","Energy statistics refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as coal, crude oil, natural gas, electricity, or renewable energy sources (biomass, geothermal, wind or solar energy), when they are used for the energy they contain."
But the period has caused a headache for climate scientists because clearly there was no upswell in carbon dioxide that could account for such swift warming.,"In 2009, further evidence was provided that changes in solar insolation provide the initial trigger for the earth to warm after an Ice Age, with secondary factors like increases in greenhouse gases accounting for the magnitude of the change.","Firstly, the definition of resilience is heavily contested, making it difficult to choose appropriate characteristics and indicators to track."
We expect to see record cold temperatures even during global warming.,"""Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end, to be followed by a long period of considerably colder temperatures leading into the next glacial age some 20,000 years from now.""","The US company SunPower produces cells that have an efficiency of 21.5%, well above the market average of 12–18%."

"Unlike the simple example of positive feedback we learned in high school, the increase from every round of feedback gets smaller and smaller, in the case of the enhanced greenhouse effect.","Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapor content makes the atmosphere warm further; this warming causes the atmosphere to hold still more water vapor (a positive feedback), and so on until other processes stop the feedback loop.","Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ""Energiewende"" have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills."
The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C),"At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F), and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi).","Contributions to climate change, whether they cool or warm the Earth, are often described in terms of the radiative forcing or imbalance they introduce to the planet's energy budget."

"At present, climate forecasts even as little as six weeks ahead can be diametrically the opposite of what actually occurs, even if the forecasts are limited to a small region of the planet.'",Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere at a future time and given location.,"As it is endorheic (has no outlet besides evaporation), it has very high salinity, far saltier than seawater, which makes swimming similar to floating, and its mineral content is steadily increasing."
"The worsening of tidal flooding in American coastal communities is largely a consequence of greenhouse gases from human activity, and the problem will grow far worse in coming decades, scientists reported Monday.","The introduction includes this statement: There is strong evidence that the warming of the Earth over the last half-century has been caused largely by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, including agriculture and deforestation.","Milwaukee tends to experience highs that are 90 °F (32 °C) on or above seven days per year, and lows at or below 0 °F (−18 °C) on six to seven nights."
The main reason behind this mid-century cooling was global dimming due to anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emissions.,"While most of the earth has warmed, the regions that are downwind from major sources of air pollution (specifically sulfur dioxide emissions) have generally cooled.","Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation."

"The 'decline' refers to a decline in northern tree-rings, not global temperature, and is openly discussed in papers and the IPCC reports.","Several scientific sources state that the decline being referred to is a decline in tree ring climate proxy metrics, not temperature.","The German city of Friedrichshafen was bombed during World War II as part of the Allied strategic bombing campaign against German war materiel industry, particularly in the targeting of German fighter aircraft production and long range missile development."
Natural temperature measurements also confirm the general accuracy of the instrumental temperature record.,"The warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations, documented by many independent scientific groups; for example, in most continental regions the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation has increased.","Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor, so that the water condenses and ""precipitates""."
“It’s horrifying that we’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change.,"Researchers expect that over time, climate change will affect mountain and lowland ecosystems, the frequency and intensity of forest fires, the diversity of wildlife, and the distribution of fresh water.","Most experts and major reports advise against relying on climate engineering techniques as a main solution to global warming, in part due to the large uncertainties over effectiveness and side effects and unforeseen consequences."
"But Trenberth’s ""lack of warming at the moment"" has been going on at least a decade.","In January 2013 James Hansen and colleagues published their updated analysis that temperatures had continued at a high level despite strong La Niña conditions, and said the ""5-year mean global temperature has been flat for a decade, which we interpret as a combination of natural variability and a slowdown in the growth rate of the net climate forcing"", noting ""that the 10 warmest years in the record all occurred since 1998.""",It is a multifaceted and holistic approach which requires a significant change in how the natural and human environments are identified.
Recent research also indicates that the quantity of fossil fuels staying in the atmosphere is much less than previously thought.,"Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), and secondarily the clearing of land, have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide, methane, and other heat-trapping (""greenhouse"") gases in the atmosphere...There is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.","Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 340 watts of solar power per square meter."
"Climate scientists have predicted global temperatures would increase more than one degree Celsius by 2020,"" but observed temperatures have been only half as high.","In the last 100 years, Earth's average surface temperature increased by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F) with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades.","Formation of sea ice further increases the salinity and density, because salt is ejected into the ocean when sea ice forms."
"Barack Obama will help the Gulf Coast restore the wetlands, marshes and barrier islands that are critical to tamping down the force of hurricanes.","On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak.",It is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world’s 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland would offset nearly 12 years of CO emissions.

"The United States is the leading nation in the world ""with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change.""","Newsweek reports that the majority of Europe and Japan accept the consensus on scientific climate change, but only one third of Americans considered human activity to play a major role in climate change in 2006; 64% believed that scientists disagreed about it ""a lot.""","In a November 2013 article in the ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"" Dessler and colleagues provide observational evidence of a positive feedback effect of stratospheric water vapor and global warming."
"Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: ‘The consensus points towards that being a real effect.’”",Scaife and his team have made recent advances in long range weather forecasting and have uncovered a signal to noise paradox in climate models that makes them better at predicting the real climate than they are at predicting themselves.,"Tide tables, sometimes called tide charts, are used for tidal prediction and show the daily times and levels of high and low tides, usually for a particular location."
"Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany, and France since the mid-1970s","Average carbon emissions within the haulage industry are falling—in the thirty-year period from 1977 to 2007, the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile journey fell by 21 percent; NOx emissions are also down 87 percent, whereas journey times have fallen by around a third.","Researchers have for the first time attributed recent floods, droughts and heat waves, to human-induced climate change."
The divergence of tree-ring proxies from temperatures after 1960 is openly discussed in the peer-reviewed literature and the last two IPCC assessment reports.,"The issues with tree rings had not been hidden, but were extensively discussed in scientific literature and in IPCC reports.","Because the economics of climate change mitigation depend a lot on how quickly carbon neutrality needs to be achieved, climate sensitivity is very important economically: one study suggests that halving the uncertainty of the transient climate response could save trillions of dollars."

"Tree-ring proxy reconstructions are reliable before 1960, tracking closely with the instrumental record and other independent proxies.",The deviation of some tree ring proxy measurements from the instrumental record since the 1950s raises the question of the reliability of tree ring proxies in the period before the instrumental temperature record.,"Due to confusing media coverage in the early 1990s, issues such as ozone depletion and climate change were often mixed up, affecting public understanding of these issues."
"Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900: a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century, before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it, and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century.","Increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.","Carbon fixation produces the intermediate three-carbon sugar product, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products."

Australia has more solar coverage than any other continent.,"Firstly, tropical continents are more reflective than open ocean, and so absorb less of the Sun's heat: most absorption of Solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans.","Correspondingly, examples for products based upon forms of carbon accounting can be found in national inventories, corporate environmental reports or carbon footprint calculators."
A South African paper has found a 21 year cycle synchronous with the solar cycle (Alexander 2007).,"Orbital forcing from cycles in the earth's orbit around the sun has, for the past 2,000 years, caused a long-term northern hemisphere cooling trend that continued through the Middle Ages and the Little Ice Age.","Wind is higher in autumn and winter, when consumption is also high."
Methane plays a minor role in global warming but could get much worse if permafrost starts to melt.,"Arctic amplification also causes methane to be released as permafrost melts, which is expected to surpass land use changes as the second strongest anthropogenic source of greenhouse gases by the end of the century.","In March 2017, putative evidence of possibly the oldest forms of life on Earth was reported in the form of fossilized microorganisms discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec, Canada, that may have lived as early as 4.28 billion years ago, not long after the oceans formed 4.4 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago."

Temperature errors in the Great Lakes region are not incorporated in any of the global mean temperature records.,"Temperature anomalies found in coastal locations are exceptional, with Røst and Værøy lacking a meteorological winter in spite of being north of the Arctic Circle.",This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole.
But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.,It is clear that major efforts are necessary to quickly and strongly reduce CO 2 emissions.,"In some instances, heavy falling snow has silenced thunder from cloud to ground lightning strikes as close as one to two miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) from the observer and severe dust storms are even more effective in many cases."
"as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease.",Recent data also shows that the concentration is increasing at a higher rate.,"Durkin responded: ""The IPCC's own figures show the hottest year in the past ten was 1998, and the temp has been flat-lining now for five years."
There is ample evidence that Earth's average temperature has increased in the past 100 years and the decline of mid- and high-latitude glaciers is a major piece of evidence.,"The history of the Himalayas broadly fits the long-term decrease in Earth's average temperature since the mid-Eocene, 40 million years ago.","In Asia during the wet season, the flow of moist air into the Himalayas leads to some of the greatest rainfall amounts measured on Earth in northeast India."

The warming causes the oceans to release CO2.,"The effect of this warm water propagates through the ocean, and reduces the amount of CO 2 that the oceans can hold in solution, which makes the oceans release large quantities of CO 2 into the atmosphere in a geologically short time (tens or thousands of years).","Carbon cycle feedbacks, the demise of coral, the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, and extreme desertification are also described, with five or six degrees of warming potentially leading to the complete uninhabitability of the tropics and subtropics, as well as extreme water and food shortages, possibly leading to mass migration of billions of people."
"Since then, the planet has been cooling on a millennial scale","In the North Atlantic, sediments accumulated since the end of the last ice age, nearly 12,000 years ago, show regular increases in the amount of coarse sediment grains deposited from icebergs melting in the now open ocean, indicating a series of 1–2 °C (2–4 °F) cooling events recurring every 1,500 years or so.","In September 2008 at a hearing of the European Parliament’s Urban Lodgment Intergroup, Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs is quoted as saying, “security of supply really starts with energy efficiency.” Energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the European Union’s Cogeneration Directive 2004/08/EC."

"“The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker.","As the temperature difference between the Arctic and the equator decreases, ocean currents that are driven by that temperature difference, like the Gulf Stream, are weakening.","According to 2011 census, the island is uninhabited."
When the exact same group of 'experts' who claimed it was global cooling in 1977 now claim it's global warming you can easily see why I am skeptical,"John Wallace of the University of Washington agreed with Lindzen that progress in climate change science had been exaggerated, but said there are ""relatively few scientists who are as skeptical of the whole thing as Dick [Lindzen] is"".",In addition the pace of change necessary to implement a carbon market approach is too slow to be effective at most international and national policy levels.
"Dr. Gutzler said spring temperatures have an impact, too, with warmer air causing more snow to turn to vapor and essentially disappear.","As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air.","The Fischer–Tropsch process starts with partial oxidation of methane (natural gas) to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen gas and water."

A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.”,"Kuhn made several claims concerning the progress of scientific knowledge: that scientific fields undergo periodic ""paradigm shifts"" rather than solely progressing in a linear and continuous way, and that these paradigm shifts open up new approaches to understanding what scientists would never have considered valid before; and that the notion of scientific truth, at any given moment, cannot be established solely by objective criteria but is defined by a consensus of a scientific community.",Commentators have argued that the climate change discourses constructed in the media have not been conducive to generating the political will for swift action.
The global trend is calculated from hundreds of CO2 measuring stations and confirmed by satellites.,"More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements reveal an accelerating rise of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017, which is a trend of roughly 30 cm (12 in) per century.","As a result, biodiversity loss is a significant risk factor in business development and a threat to long term economic sustainability."

Warming causes more moisture in the air which leads to more extreme precipitation events.,"As air gets warmer, it can hold more moisture.",The Earth's orbit approximates an ellipse.
Recent research also indicates that the quantity of fossil fuels staying in the atmosphere is much less than previously thought.,"Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), and secondarily the clearing of land, have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide, methane, and other heat-trapping (""greenhouse"") gases in the atmosphere...There is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.","This cooling had contributed towards the recent Global warming hiatus in surface temperatures, and would change to enhanced surface warming in the next phase of the oscillation."
" As it happens, the writer of that October 2009 e-mail—Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the warmist bible, the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report—told Congress two years ago that evidence for manmade warming is ""unequivocal.","In October 2009, the leaders of 18 US scientific societies and organizations sent an open letter to the United States Senate reaffirming the scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and is primarily caused by human activities.","The tax also applied to electricity produced by hydro and nuclear power, but exempted renewable energy sources such as geothermal, solar, and wind."

"“To revisit the ocean’s paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long.",The major influence on δ18O is the difference between ocean temperatures where the moisture evaporated and the place where the final precipitation occurred; since ocean temperatures are relatively stable the δ18O value mostly reflects the temperature where precipitation occurs.,Rose Bygrave (born 1955) is an Australian singer/songwriter.
To claim that humidity is decreasing requires you ignore a multitude of independent reanalyses that all show increasing humidity.,"As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases.","The European Union, for example, got more 64% of its renewable energy from biomass (mostly wood) but United Nations and EU rules did not count the carbon emissions from burning biomass."
"Human-produced carbon might be one of the factors [of climate change], but there’s simply no evidence that it is a significant one.","According to the United States National Research Council, [T]here is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines of research, documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities.","It would cost more for countries in these areas to respond to coral reef loss as they would need to turn to different sources of income and food, in addition to losing other ecosystem services such as ecotourism."
"""[Models] are full of fudge factors that are fitted to the existing climate, so the models more or less agree with the observed data.","The idea of 'too baroque' is connected to 'simplicity': ""a theory jammed with fudge factors is not very elegant.","The methodology NFS AM001, does not involve predicting land use changes in specific places at specific times, but applies a risk-based approach to baseline quantification which allows for a programmatic approach to reducing emissions."
"according, again, to the official figures—during this past 10 years, if anything, mean global temperature, average world temperature, has slightly declined.","In the scientific literature, there is an overwhelming consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.","To keep warming below 2 °C, more stringent emission reductions in the near-term would allow for less rapid reductions after 2030."

"For decades, most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect.","Scientists have identified many episodes of climate change during Earth's geological history; more recently since the industrial revolution the climate has increasingly been affected by human activities driving global warming, and the terms are commonly used interchangeably in that context.","Most of the discharge of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is via the five major ice streams (faster flowing ice) entering the Ross Ice Shelf, the Rutford Ice Stream entering Ronne-Filchner shelf of the Weddell Sea, and the Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier entering the Amundsen Ice Shelf."
"Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.","The effects of global warming in the Arctic, or climate change in the Arctic include rising air and water temperatures, loss of sea ice, and melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a related cold temperature anomaly, observed since the 1970s.","At the 2009 National Hurricane Conference, he announced he would resign January 21, 2009."
"there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,","These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers.","The techniques used depend on which variable has to be reconstructed (temperature, precipitation or something else) and on how long ago the climate of interest occurred."
"On the other side of the Atlantic ocean, climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream.","East winds moving over this warm water move warm air from over the Gulf Stream inland, helping to keep temperatures milder across the state than elsewhere across the Southeast during the winter.","In the +2.0 C (global warming) Scenario total primary energy demand in 2040 can be 450 EJ = 10755 Mtoe, or 400 EJ = 9560 Mtoe in the +1.5 Scenario, well below the current production."

‘Clean coal’ is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground.,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) (or carbon capture and sequestration or carbon control and sequestration) is the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO 2) usually from large point sources, such as a cement factory or biomass power plant, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere, normally an underground geological formation.","The overall increase in rice production throughout the 1980s was the result of higher productivity per hectare, rather than of an increase in the land area planted in rice ; in fact, the area planted in rice decreased during the 1980s, from 732,000 hectares in 1980 to 657,000 hectares in 1990."
"But more than 7% of deaths are related to cold—counting hypothermia, as well as increased blood pressure and risk of heart attack that results when the body restricts blood flow in response to frigid temperatures.”","For example, plunged into freezing seas, around 20% of victims die within two minutes from cold shock (uncontrolled rapid breathing, and gasping, causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to cardiac arrest, and panic); another 50% die within 15–30 minutes from cold incapacitation (inability to use or control limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body ""protectively"" shuts down the peripheral muscles of the limbs to protect its core).","More than 600 boreholes, on all continents, have been used as proxies for reconstructing surface temperatures."
The idea that the much smaller carbon dioxide cycle is now controlling the water cycle is not very likely.,"At higher temperatures, CO 2 has poor solubility in water, which means there is less CO 2 available for the photosynthetic reactions.","The transient response is lower than the equilibrium sensitivity because the deep ocean, which takes many centuries to reach a new steady state after a perturbation, continues to serve as a sink for heat from the upper ocean."
Warming causes more moisture in the air which leads to more extreme precipitation events.,"As air gets warmer, it can hold more moisture.",This increase of and other long-lived greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere has produced the current episode of global warming.

"Rising CO2 increases atmospheric water vapor, which makes global warming much worse.","Increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.","Maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption, the wind may peak at night when power isn't needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest."
Australian households will benefit to the tune of $550 a year if the carbon tax is axed.,"The average household pays US$21 towards the tax each year, while the average business pays $94 per year.","Given that greenhouse gas levels are already elevated, the lag of decades between emissions and some impacts, and the significant economic and political challenges of success, the IPCC group points out that it is uncertain how much climate change ""will"" be mitigated."
A new article in Nature Geoscience  describes an innovative approach employed to derive ice-mass changes  from GRACE data.,"A 2006 paper derived from satellite data, measuring changes in the gravity of the ice mass, suggests that the total amount of ice in Antarctica has begun decreasing in the past few years.","This change in the moment of inertia results in [[true polar wander]], in which the Earth's rotational axis remains fixed with respect to the sun, but the rigid sphere of the Earth rotates with respect to it."
Economic assessments of proposed policy to put a price on carbon emissions are in widespread agreement that the net economic impact will be minor.,This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions.,"Despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines, the rapid growth of air travel in the past years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation."
Extreme weather isn't caused by global warming,Scientists attribute extreme weather to man-made climate change.,"Within the region, desert/semi-desert (California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas), Mediterranean (California), humid subtropical (Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee), and tropical (Florida) climates can be found."

"Many lines of evidence, including simple accounting, demonstrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is due to human fossil fuel burning.","The introduction includes this statement: There is strong evidence that the warming of the Earth over the last half-century has been caused largely by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, including agriculture and deforestation.",Many of the news outlets that reported on Nordhaus's prize noted that he was in the advance wave of economists who embraced a carbon tax as a preferred method of carbon pricing.
warmer oceans have also begun to destabilize glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica,"The three main reasons warming causes global sea level to rise are: oceans expand, ice sheets lose ice faster than it forms from snowfall, and glaciers at higher altitudes also melt.","In recent decades, northern China has experienced increased drought, and southern China has received increased summer rain resulting in a larger number of floods."
"A longer and warmer growing season also has an effect, Dr. Overpeck said, as plants take up more water, further reducing stream flows.","Increased temperatures and altered hydrological cycles are predicted to translate to shorter growing seasons, overall reduced biomass production, and lower grain yields.","He resigned on September 10, 2007, in the wake of his arrest the previous week on corruption charges."

"“CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases.","Being a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in Earth's atmosphere where it is also a potent greenhouse gas along with other gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.",Cyclone Namu attained peak intensity of 120 km/h.
"The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.","In the early and middle Ordovician, temperatures were mild, but at the beginning of the Late Ordovician, from 460 to 450 Ma, volcanoes along the margin of the Iapetus Ocean spewed massive amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, turning the planet into a hothouse.",Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover should exhibit a decreasing trend to explain an observed increase in Northern Hemisphere spring air temperatures this century.
The geological history of the planet shows major planetary climate changes have never been driven by a trace gas,"Rennie 2009: ""Claim 1: Anthropogenic CO2 can't be changing climate, because CO2 is only a trace gas in the atmosphere and the amount produced by humans is dwarfed by the amount from volcanoes and other natural sources.","The mechanisms linking air pollution to increased cardiovascular mortality are uncertain, but probably include pulmonary and systemic inflammation."

global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed (since 1997) by 19 years of stable temperature,"An example of such an episode is the slower rate of surface temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, which was dubbed the global warming hiatus.","In blogs, talk radio and other new media, we are told that the warnings about future global warming issued by the national science academies, scientific societies, and governments of all the leading nations are not only mistaken, but based on a hoax, indeed a conspiracy that must involve thousands of respected researchers."
The global surface mean temperature-change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing more than a propaganda tool to the public.,"Climate scientists, especially in the United States, have reported government and oil-industry pressure to censor or suppress their work and hide scientific data, with directives not to discuss the subject in public communications.","In 2012 in ""The New York Times"", economist Paul Krugman cited Romm on the connection between drought and Climate change, and ""The Atlantic"" interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the Democrats to discuss climate change."

This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans.,"As the concentration of carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, the increased uptake of carbon dioxide into the oceans is causing a measurable decrease in the pH of the oceans, which is referred to as ocean acidification.","Environmental lobby groups protested that the emissions reductions targets were too low, and that the level of assistance to polluters was too high."
When the exact same group of 'experts' who claimed it was global cooling in 1977 now claim it's global warming you can easily see why I am skeptical,"Trend sceptics or deniers (who deny there is global warming), [and] argue that no significant climate warming is taking place at all, claiming that the warming trend measured by weather stations is an artefact due to urbanisation around those stations (""urban heat island effect"").","In 2018, about 2.3 per cent of the electric energy produced in Spain was produced in coal-burning power plants."
