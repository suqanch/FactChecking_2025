Our evolving dynamic planet has survived[…] mass extinctions,"The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals.","However, there may be some weak links in this chain of events: the changes in the C/C ratio expected to result from a massive release of methane do not match the patterns seen throughout the early Triassic; and the types of oceanic thermohaline circulation that may have existed at the end of the Permian are not likely to have supported deep-sea anoxia."
"Together, these two unaltered [sea level] datasets indicate that global mean sea level trend has remained stable over the entire period 1992-2007, altogether eliminating the apparent 3.2 mm/year rate of sea-level rise arising from the “adjusted” data.",Measurements by Jason-1 indicate that mean sea level has been rising at an average rate of 2.28 millimeters (.09 inches) per year since 2001.,Sediment cores taken from Puyehue Lake in 2001 and 2002 have been interpreted as supporting the existence of the Little Ice Age in the Southern Hemisphere.

Let’s find out by comparing the actual temperatures since 1979 with what the 32 families of climate models used in the latest U.N. report on climate science predicted they would be.,Models referenced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predict that global temperatures are likely to increase by 1.1 to 6.4 °C (2.0 to 11.5 °F) between 1990 and 2100.,"Before the establishment of ice age theories, many stories and legends were woven around the giant ``erratic blocks'' of rock."
"The thermal expansion of the oceans, compounded by melting glaciers, resulted in the highest global sea level on record in 2015.","The three main reasons warming causes global sea level to rise are: oceans expand, ice sheets lose ice faster than it forms from snowfall, and glaciers at higher altitudes also melt.",Past Climate Variability in South America and Surrounding Regions.
"Also, it's not yet clear whether changes in stratospheric water vapor are caused by a climate feedback or internal variability","Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.""","He wrote: ""This negative correlation contradicts the results of the models that IPCC relies on and indicates that anthropogenic global warming (AGW) is quite small,"" concluding ""and now it turns out that global warming might have been 'man made' after all."
"Greenland on the whole is losing ice, as confirmed by multiple satellite and on the ground field measurements.","Findings show that Greenland has lost 3.8 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, enough to raise sea levels by almost 11mm (1.06cm).","Global warming boosts the probability of extreme weather events, like heat waves, far more than it boosts more moderate events."
The sun has not warmed since 1970 and so cannot be driving global warming.,"Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency.","To raise awareness of climate issues, a global climate strike took place for a week in late September 2019: countries around the world showed unity within their communities as people rallied together in groups- demanding action to take place for a better future and swarming the streets of cities to march and voice their dissatisfaction with the environment they currently live in."
"The statement that so-called greenhouse gases,  especially CO2, contribute to near-surface atmospheric warming is in  glaring contradiction to well-known physical laws relating to gas and  vapour, as well as to general caloric theory.'","It said that Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.","George Wilkenfield, in ""Australian Review of Public Affairs"", is more critical and suggests the book feels ""strangely anachronistic"", partly because it treats climate change as an issue that can be resolved through grassroots activism or by the opposition of protest movements to unjust regimes."

UAH atmospheric temperatures prove climate models and/or surface temperature data sets are wrong.,"In comparing these measurements to surface temperature models, it is important to note that values for the lower troposphere measurements taken by the MSU are a weighted average of temperatures over multiple altitudes (roughly 0 to 12 km), and not a surface temperature (as seen in figure above).","Exhaust heat is wasted, unless it can be used directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating."
"Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere.","Consequently, the air above coastal lands heats up faster than the air above seas.","Nuclear, which had supplied 30 percent of Japanese electricity from 1987 to 2011, supplied only 2 percent in 2012 (hydropower supplied 8 percent)."
This growth stimulation occurs because CO2 is one of the two raw materials (the other being water) that are required for photosynthesis.,"Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars from which other organic compounds can be constructed, and oxygen is produced as a by-product.",The policy has been criticized by some environmentalists.
"Within a decade, certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct, reef scientists say, along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators.","In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals.",Volcanoes are the largest source but there are also anthropogenic sources.

Dropped weather stations actually show a slightly warmer trend compared to kept stations.,The Newswatch branding was dropped after 28 years to coincide with the switch.,"Media coverage of climate change has had effects on public opinion on climate change, as it mediates the scientific opinion on climate change that the global instrumental temperature record shows increase in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases."
" As it happens, the writer of that October 2009 e-mail—Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the warmist bible, the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report—told Congress two years ago that evidence for manmade warming is ""unequivocal.","IPCC AR5 WG1 Summary for Policymakers 2013, p. 4: Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia.","In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed."
A generous estimate of the energy generated by satellites is around 1 million times too small to cause global warming.,"The radiative forcing capacity (RF) is the amount of energy per unit area, per unit time, absorbed by the greenhouse gas, that would otherwise be lost to space.","Since the rising parcel of air is losing energy as it does work on the surrounding atmosphere and no energy is transferred into it as heat from the atmosphere to make up for the loss, the parcel of air is losing energy, which manifests itself as a decrease in the temperature of the air parcel."

"Over the past one million years climate cycles ranging from Ice Ages to warmer periods have been caused by changing levels of energy from the sun, planetary alignments and ocean currents.","Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.","Solar heating systems are a well known second-generation technology and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage."
The lack of any sunspots suggests the current solar minimum is one of the 'deepest' in 100 years.,"In total, there seem to have been 18 periods of sunspot minima in the last 8,000 years, and studies indicate that the Sun currently spends up to a quarter of its time in these minima.","However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation."
"In the early 2000s, ice shelves began disintegrating in several parts of Antarctica, and scientists realized that process could greatly accelerate the demise of the vastly larger ice sheets themselves.","In the last several decades, glaciologists have observed consistent decreases in ice shelf extent through melt, calving, and complete disintegration of some shelves.","Determine the best mitigation and get agreement on final, acceptable risk levels, possibly based on cost/benefit analysis."
Ancient natural cycles are irrelevant for attributing recent global warming to humans.,"In the scientific literature, there is an overwhelming consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.","Although the parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below in the Paris Agreement, the Earth's average surface temperature has already increased by about half this threshold and current pledges by countries to cut emissions are inadequate to limit future warming."
The temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted.,"Confidence in model estimates is higher for some climate variables (e.g., temperature) than for others (e.g., precipitation).","Between 2001, which was the first year Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects could be registered, and 2012, the end of the first Kyoto commitment period, the CDM is expected to produce some 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (COe) in emission reductions."
They all confirm the original hockey stick conclusion: the 20th century is the warmest in the last 1000 years and that warming was most dramatic after 1920.,"A wide variety of temperature proxies together prove that the 20th century was the hottest recorded in the last 2,000 years.","As Brook notes the ""principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical, economic or fuel-related, but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance, fiscal and political inertia, and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing [the other] low-carbon alternatives."
"Some scientists believe that solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide, and Dr Soon has compiled data showing temperature in America, Canada and Mexico rises and falls in line with solar activity.","Our results show that the observed rapid rise in global mean temperatures seen after 1985 cannot be ascribed to solar variability, whichever of the mechanisms is invoked and no matter how much the solar variation is amplified.","Tropical cyclones, a source of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction (southern hemisphere) or counter clockwise (northern hemisphere)."
